WooCommerce powers many online stores across the internet, and your help making it even more awesome will be greatly appreciated :)

- Testing open [issues](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/issues) or [pull requests](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/pulls) and sharing your findings in a comment.
- Testing WooCommerce beta versions and release candidates. Those are announced in the [WooCommerce development blog](https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/).

## Coding Guidelines and Development üõ†

- Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/)
- Run our build process described in the document on [how to set up WooCommerce development environment](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/wiki/How-to-set-up-WooCommerce-development-environment), it will install our pre-commit hook, code sniffs, dependencies, and more.
- Whenever possible please fix pre-existing code standards errors in the files that you change. It is ok to skip that for larger files or complex fixes.
- Ensure you use LF line endings in your code editor. Use [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) if your editor supports it so that indentation, line endings and other settings are auto configured.
- When committing, reference your issue number (#1234) and include a note about the fix.
- Ensure that your code supports the minimum supported versions of PHP and WordPress; this is shown at the top of the `readme.txt` file.
- Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request on the master branch of the WooCommerce repository.
- Make sure to write good and detailed commit messages (see [this post](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for more on this) and follow all the applicable sections of the pull request template.
- Please avoid modifying the changelog directly or updating the .pot files. These will be updated by the WooCommerce team.

If you are contributing code to the REST API or editor blocks, these are developed in external packages.
- [WooCommerce REST API package](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-rest-api)
